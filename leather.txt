Artificial leather, also called synthetic leather, is a material intended to substitute for leather in upholstery, clothing, footwear, and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is known under many names, including leatherette, imitation leather, faux leather, vegan leather, PU leather, and pleather



Artificial leathers are often used in clothing fabrics, furniture upholstery, and automotive uses.[8] One disadvantage of plastic-coated artificial leather is that it is not porous and does not allow air to pass through, allowing sweat to accumulate if it is used for items that will be in continuous contact with a person's body, such as clothing and car seat coverings. One of its primary advantages, especially in cars, is that it requires little maintenance in comparison to leather, and does not crack or fade easily, though the surface of some artificial leathers may rub and wear off with time.
